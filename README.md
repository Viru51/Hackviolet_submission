## Inspiration

As we know in this modern industry, it's very difficult for companies to retain their employees, so churn-o-meter basically helps them to decide what factors should be looked more upon for employee retention.

## What it does

churn-o-meter analysis all the factors including promotion, salary, work hour, quality work, work satisfaction, etc of all employees and show us what changes can be introduced in the company for employee retention.

## How we built it

 - [ ] Data Collection : Collected the data from online competitions
 - [ ] Data preprocessing : Used python to preprocess and clean data
 - [ ] Data Analysing : Used seaborn to analyze the data and perfrom EDA
 - [ ] Data Presentation : Used Tableau to presents actionable insights from the data

## Challenges we ran into

 - Limited knowledge about Tableau  made it quite challenging to complete the project

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

 - We were able to complete the project as well as create a dashboard which can be used by anyone!

## What we learned

 - We learned how data science can be used to solve a businsess problem

## What's next for Churn-o-meter

 - We want to make a full fledge HR analytics software
